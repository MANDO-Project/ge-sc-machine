# ngraph.forcelayout demo

This folder contains a demo of the `ngraph.forcelayout` package.

If you drop any `.dot` file into the browser window the demo will attempt to visualize it.


### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm start
```

This should render a simple graph and you can do some basic layout. You can drop `.dot` files into it
to load new graphs.

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

## What's inside?

* [ngraph.graph](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.graph) as a graph data structure
* [ngraph.forcelayout](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.forcelayout) for the basic graph layout
* [w-gl](https://github.com/anvaka/w-gl) - super duper obscure (and fast) WebGL renderer.
* vue.js powered UI and dev tools.
